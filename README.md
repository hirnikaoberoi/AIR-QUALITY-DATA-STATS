# AIR-QUALITY-DATA-STATS
While developing a user-friendly programme that can display pollution levels of various Asian countries, the user can create and work on new databases and tables for analysis of air pollution levels (AQI) of different places, as well as perform various types of statistical analysis of different places, such as sorting, grouping, systematic arranging, and so on. This is a one-time-use software, and the table it creates will be deleted after the first usage. Microcubic metre is the unit used to enter data. Its purpose is to do a comprehensive data analysis using tables. The data analysed can also be used to create new techniques to tackling rising levels of air pollution in diverse regions, as well as improve existing ones. Statistics can also be used to assess the effectiveness of previous strategies.
